_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer:
    I think Lazada, because when you browse the website of Lazada it will show you all of its category. From Electronic Device to Automotives and Motorcycle.
-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: For me, i find the win gadget game wheel in shopee distractive. Specially in the mobile application, we can click those elements while we are scrolling. ![Alt text](image.png)

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: I think that Shopee is more organized. I find it easier to scan and understand. Maybe because I am more familiar with Shopee because I rarely checkout orders in Lazada. 

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Yes, both website are visually pleasing and consistent. I still remember when I am browsing those two websites a few years ago, I can definitely say that there are improvements in terms of design and they are consistent with their brand.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer:
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer:I think that Shopee is better than Lazada in terms of visual aspect of the website. I prefer more the design of Shopee because of its color compare to Lazada.
